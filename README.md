This is the repository of smart contracts and source code for the Eureka Project.

## What is Eureka?

Making money by hodling cryptocurrency often means resisting the temptation to sell your tokens in a bull market. The path to profit will normally require making it through several bull markets and resisting that tempation several times. Eureka seeks to make resisting that temptation easier.

Eureka's smart contracts allow a hodler to deposit their tokens in a timelocked vault which prevents the tokens being traded for a certain (user defined) period of time. On the expiry of the timelock period the tokens can be withdrawn by the user from their vault.

Eureka's smart contracts also provide a vault in which tokens can be deposited to be staked in a liquidity pool with pool rewards harvested after a specified period of time has elapsed or a specified value of rewards have accumulated. Harvested rewards are returned to the vault for distribution to one or more accounts in either a predetermined ratio or a ratio set at the time of distribution.
